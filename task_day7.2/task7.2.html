                    <p>Plastic plates, cups, cutlery and drink stirrers can’t be recycled easily at our recycling facilities, even when they are made from recyclable plastic. These items are wrong shape or are too light to be sorted correctly by recycling machines, which are designed to separate larger items like bottles and tubs.

                    Recycling machines will often mistakenly sort plastic dinnerware as paper. The plastic items end up contaminating the paper and cardboard products and significantly reduce the quality of the recycled paper products.

                    After being used for only a few minutes, disposable dinnerware ends up in landfill or worse, as litter on our streets or in our parks and waterways for potentially hundreds of years.</p>
