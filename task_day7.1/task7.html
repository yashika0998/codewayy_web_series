    <h2>Horror Story!</h2>
    <p>We bought an old house, 
        my boyfriend and I. He's in charge of the "new" construction – converting the kitchen in 
        to the master bedroom for instance, while I'm on wallpaper removal duty.</p>
    <p>The previous owner papered EVERY wall and CEILING! Removing it is brutal, 
       but oddly satisfying. The best feeling is getting a long peel, similar to your skin 
       when you're peeling from a sunburn.</p>
    <p>I don't know about you but I kinda make a game of peeling,
       on the hunt for the longest piece before it rips.
       Under a corner section of paper in every room is a person’s name and a date.
       Curiosity got the best of me one night when I Googled one of the names and discovered
       the person was actually a missing person, the missing date matching the date under the wallpaper! </p>
    <p>The next day, I made a list of all the names and dates. 
       Sure enough each name was for a missing person with dates to match.
        We notified the police who naturally sent out the crime scene team.
        I overhead one tech say "yup, it's human." Human? What's human? "Ma'am,
        where is the material you removed from the walls already? </p>
    <p>This isn't wallpaper you were removing."</p>
